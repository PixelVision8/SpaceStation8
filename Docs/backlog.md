I plan on continuing to clean this up and add new functionality over the next few weeks. You can file bugs here, request features here, and submit new levels here. I plan to add an easier way to load maps and collect some of the best ones to be included as part of the download.

Here is a rundown of all the features I plan on adding:

- Level loading system - A simple way to cycle through levels in the Space Station 8/levels folder.
- Renaming maps - A built-in system for organizing maps.
- Favorite maps - have a way to jump to a collection of maps to play quickly.
- Level collections - make a series of maps to play as a set via some kind of naming convention.
- More sound effects - Add effects for all interactions in the game.
- In-game help - Add some modal or tooltips that tell the player what to do.
- Switches - a way to wire up the switch and link it to something specific.
- ~~Hanging spikes (done) - add support for looking at spike collision when jumping up into them.~~
- Unified physics system - Add support for an entity to run in the player's physics engine.
- Abstract out player - Make player and entities work the same way in the physics engine.
- Clean up code - remove old code, condense logic to share, and document.
- Port to C# - Make a C# version of the game once the Lua one is finished.
- ~~Wiki - move docs into a wiki.~~
- ~~New icon - Create a custom icon for the exe.~~
- Dedicated site - Build a github.io page for the game. 
- Add to itch.io - Create a permanent place for people to find and download.
